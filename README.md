## Logging in

A **driver** uses their name and their vehicle's plate number (a driver can have more than one vehicle).  
An **admin** uses a nickname and a password.

&nbsp;

## Registering New Vehicles

An **admin** can register a new vehicle by filling out some information like the vehicle's plate number and its type.

&nbsp;

## Vehicle Details

An **admin** can look up a vehicle's details using its plate number.  
This page also allows the **admin** to cross out the vehicle or submit a violation under it.

Crossed out vehicles' violations don't show up in search results.

## Submitting Violations

After looking up a vehicle's details, an **admin** can submit a new violation under it.

## Searching for Violations

An **admin** can retrieve all committed violations for *vehicles that aren't crossed-out* while a **driver** can only see their own committed violations.  
Leaving the fields empty would retrieve all available violations.

## Violation Details

This page will again vary depending on the user's authority.  
A **driver** can use this page to pay the violation while an **admin** can edit some of its details.
